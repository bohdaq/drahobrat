1
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:10,666
Everything fine? It's so soft 
(snow), pleasure (to ride)
one more (guy) on otherside

2
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:16,338
everyone started from there?
Is everything fine with you?
I have not appropriate skies

3
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:21,694
I have joined fucking bullshit
you don't have skies and
don't have sticks

4
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:28,167
one more person on that side,
did you simply go down?
yeah

5
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:37,276
awesome
then i turned to right to
give you direction

6
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:46,652
where's Markish?
Markish on the top.
riding slope

7
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:55,127
take a look at the guy sliding
down on his ass, fuck, where?
guys take a look at me

8
00:14:55,127 --> 00:15:05,854
do you see where the trace from
the skies? your path there
between spruces

9
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:12,695
don't go to the right because
you need to go through that
hill by feet

10
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:32,798
(explaining the same)

11
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:38,938
that's the place where we need
to gather
ride here

12
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:52,468
it was scary a bit, but snow
is like butter,
you need wider skies

13
00:15:52,468 --> 00:16:01,060
let's go
come to us (inaudible)
i had the same on board

14
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:12,037
win, win, win,
fuck everything else

15
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:43,902
Thanks Mr. Roman for
ride and skills

16
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,621
Skills are yours

17
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:48,824
Are you going for another ride?

18
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,926
I'm going

19
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,628
Snowboarder who was lost
is going for another ride

20
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,731
I'm not going as I'm not able
to ride such snow honestly

21
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,004
Staying in touch

22
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:09,194
It's funny

23
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,291
Sit near me

24
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:32,384
You're standing at the bottom
and looking at the mountain,
that's the right  and left side

25
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:37,789
But we recognize sides
the way we ride. Looking
from top to bottom

26
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,543
That's where our right and left
Do you understand, yeah?

27
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,345
Because the way we look
the way we ride

28
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:45,480
Now we are looking
at the ski lift

29
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:47,516
That one

30
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,318
During the ride we shall
not cross that lift

31
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:54,206
On the left that deep dive

32
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:56,842
That deep dive called "couloir"

33
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,245
Second navigation sign.
Between us peak is located

34
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:05,801
There is tree. We cross it
by diagonal

35
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:10,689
From there, from that
arm, the path is to
the first valley

36
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,141
where the line of
spruces are growing

37
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:20,665
no, you're simply riding.
there is no hill to climb

38
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:26,655
second trail, where the
sign from snowmobile
in the middle,
more narrow

39
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,609
there you pick the line to that
forest, it's a gentle slope

40
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:38,500
you can pass this track, or
you can go through the forest
and ski lift if you have good
speed

41
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,088
looking from here it's on
the left, on that tongue,
you can ride there boldly

42
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,109
there if all four of us  will
stay in one line, there will
be enough space for all

43
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:53,432
snowcat can ride there
and you are able, then going
straight, in shadow snow is fine

44
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:59,070
yeah, between forest
and ski lift here to
the bottom

45
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,493
here you'll feel the snow
will be clammy

46
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:09,097
that snow may slide or may not
The most important is not to ride
ahead of the skies

47
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:13,702
and going back here, if we are
heading there

48
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,139
that's rough plan

49
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:23,228
a bit higher than that ski lift

50
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:33,638
no need, we arrive, see the
mountains from both sides
and slide down here on the arm

51
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:42,497
it has a long horizontal cut,
and from where you've started,
you're simply riding,
don't miss out

52
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:46,785
do not travere, you have
good horizontal line

53
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,088
here the ski lift, here is
another slope, don't
go there

54
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:58,914
you can here, I think
near ten people will fit

55
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,684
and from here how
(to get to the centre)?

56
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:07,005
so from here, we are going
by the car (snowcat)?
are you gonna get us?

57
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:14,029
or we should take to the right?
take to the right

58
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,366
ok, then look

59
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:27,475
or you can, fuck, go (inaudible),
because we have a queue

60
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:31,796
snowcat, slide down,
four turns to the side
yes

61
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,466
and then i'm going to
get you from here

62
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,752
and then we'll take a look

63
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:43,341
i'm gonna get you
up to "skronya"
and you 'll get bonus descend

64
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:50,165
clear. going down via snowcat
is only when you don't have
equipment or can't

65
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:53,919
clear. then car will going
to get us from here

66
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,772
to have a logic of self
slope riding, who
wants where

67
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:02,310
Do you understand?
Everything clear?

68
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,615
I've ride that slope
by myself

69
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:10,368
on the top will stay
and take a look

70
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:19,527
and those who were
riding slow, we'll wait
for them to ride a bit

71
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:26,034
anyway, that 2 min wait,
we'll reach them and
outpace them

72
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:33,425
and will wait for them
but we'll better look
from there (the top)

73
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,662
to see where there are,
we'll give 2-3 min handicap

74
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:43,802
I don't see any company here
maybe they jumped off

75
00:26:52,627 --> 00:27:00,869
I went, and ski went sleek,
but when that "cacao" started
I feel skies are sticking

76
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:06,841
and I understand, when i
make a turn, turning only me,
not skies

77
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:12,714
like this, head and legs,
and the only possibility is to
give straight line

78
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:21,906
but guys, there are a couple
of moments, when it's windy
or when it's sunny

79
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:28,163
every hour, that's the
other slope

80
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:34,019
and if the sun will hide
behind the mountain,
and you'll go for thirds turn

81
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,555
be ready to ride with
a speed of a car

82
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:45,797
"pedal to floor" so called
slope is frozen
and no control

83
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:52,287
speed will be incredible,
the slope will be like a glass
Of course

84
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:14,025
Roman let me write your
phone number
of course, what's your name?


85
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:18,179
Bohdan
Hi Bohdan, my passed away
brother was named Bohdan

86
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:24,769
(telling number)

87
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:32,610
Why Oaza (ski loft)  doesn't
work? It's all resulted
to the fact

88
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:38,566
that there are not a lot of
people, plus quarantine,
transport doesn't work

89
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:43,805
I think for the owner it was
not profitable for 2-3 people
make busy a lot of personnel

90
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:48,493
work for regional electric
provide. one engine here
consumes 100 kWh on a ski lift

91
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:54,165
plus to start all of these
plus feed all of them and
you understand that every day

92
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:58,670
if you don't have profit, you
consume profit from winter

93
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:04,109
we had the same situation
on the central slope
on Drahobrat, Kuryatnya

94
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:10,248
the personnel went out, only
locals left in pulse mode
On Kuryatnya, Vasya is

95
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,617
doing two jobs simultaneously,
operating ski lift and selling
ski passes

96
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,336
rental guy also dispatcher
for instructors, we work
through the school

97
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:19,674
people came, took equipment,
paid out to the dispatcher,
at the appointer time

98
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:26,548
the instructor arrived, person
worked, you feel safe,
plus you can schedule a day

99
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,050
you are going somewhere,
sleeping...

100
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:09,891
*looking on Maps for direction*

101
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:21,336
Ehehey, i'm heading to Oaza

102
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:40,768
you have specified time,
you have to whom talk to

103
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,454
on the phone, where that
instructor disappeared

104
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,457
and he may have already
planned his personal life
and enjoying

105
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:51,562
on the instruction of winter
*inaudible*, who has snot,
that one on the bottom

106
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,249
the one who has what?
the one who has snot
is on the bottom

107
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:58,653
what if both have snot?
snot?
yes

108
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:03,658
there is always something like
I'm on the right, you're on the
right, I'm on top, you're on top

109
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:06,360
we won't be able to walk
to "Kuryatnya" from here?

110
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,364
let's see, are you going
for another ride?
I'm simply asking what to do

111
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:15,636
no, are you going one more time?
for one more descend

112
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,239
i'm thinking, if i can reach
"Kuryatnya" from here

113
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,460
but we are not going to
"Kuryatnya", we gather here
and move to slope peak

114
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,679
like i'm showing via my hand

115
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,999
and going back here,
riding slope down to the car

116
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,384
there is no other way,
only if you want...

117
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:34,038
I'm asking if "Kuryatnya" is
long away from here

118
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,723
right after "Psyachiy" pass

119
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:41,562
about 200 meters you'll
need to go by feet uphill

120
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:45,349
on top, there is a station,
that kennel, do you see it?

121
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:51,456
after reaching it going
down and moving right

122
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:56,394
200 meters and
you're on "Chayka"

123
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:08,973
Everything is fine?
Yes

124
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:18,282
Whose snowboard
wants to move the slope?
Don't leave it

125
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:24,088
Last year, Vitaliy
Kopeyking is saying,

126
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:30,027
the woman comes which
took snowboard for rent

127
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:33,064
and saying that snowboard fell
on the other side of the hill

128
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:38,369
and that she'll give 1000 UAH
for that snowboard to return

129
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:44,175
I and Eugene thought why not?
Used ski lift, descended
down the hill about 100 meters

130
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:48,479
Stayed and saw snowboard
starring from the ground
Hooray, we found it

131
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:56,187
Tightened it to the bag, looking
on the bottom, from the snow
only some colors seen

132
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,373
and that's another snowboard
who was lost at the beginning
of the winter

133
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:03,127
Snowboard, once it's lost
and jumping to the bottom
of the hill can drop on binding

134
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,730
or protrude from the snow,
like a rocket

135
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,734
grabing second snowboard,
i've tightened to my bag,
once we at Vitalik's place

136
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:14,572
He looks at boards and saying
that's not the lost one, but I'm
buying immediately

137
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:25,366
In 45 minutes we sold
2 snowboards, and going
for the third one

138
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:34,659
Ski lift worker is telling,
guys ascended the hill,
stayed to make a photo

139
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:43,150
4 snowboards put againsts
ski lift, gust of wind, 4 boards
like domino fell

140
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:49,040
4 boards one after another,
like ducks one after another

141
00:36:53,344 --> 00:37:04,138
I'm going to tell you, my friend,
once you descended somewhere
and don't know the route

142
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:10,211
and you don't have snowshoes
neither sticks and your board
costs like Jeep from Poland

143
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:15,833
so, somewhere at the 10th kilometer
of your wandering, it costs zero
and you're throwing it away

144
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:20,004
because you understand that
you cannot carry it

145
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:24,575
you're going 20 meters
in such snow for an hour

146
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:49,113
Did you start from "Jandarm"
with me or with another Roman?
I slid down with you

147
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:59,190
Somewhere near half of the slope
So tell me, please,  why did you
go there where you shouldn't?

148
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:06,363
I'm in shock, I was thinking
just for a moment, I went
off the route

149
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:11,418
I knew that I need to turn left
but why are you not doing this?
I turned not enough

150
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:19,160
I have even seen a red sign
more than asking I wouldn't
do more for you

151
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,382
you don't need to behave like
that, I was simply sliding down
here for the first time

152
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:31,338
you've been shown points
of direction, go to the first
then to another

153
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:38,913
sorry, i've relaxed just for
a few seconds, okay

154
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:49,006
because you're alone
and no one knows which
direction you selected

155
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:54,512
if something happens to you,
unlikely someone will help you
yeah, understand this dangerous

156
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:23,941
I've simply gone too much forward
I knew I need to turn left but
turned too late, sorry

157
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:32,633
are we going for another ride?
dude, I didn't enjoy it, first of
all I'm complete null in this

158
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:44,728
second, wet snow, I'm not
prepared for that, I would go
for a couple of times

159
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:55,806
we'll see and decide
guys, one moment, the way we
discussed, don't invent a bicycle

160
00:42:55,806 --> 00:43:02,680
one more turn, one more hill,
I'll find a way, no you won't
the mountain won't let you out

161
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,036
there is a reason why the route
is being preselected, indicators
of direction, I see spruce

162
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:18,362
you see an apple tree, we discuss
indicators which we don't pass
through or by which we turn

163
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:27,988
I didn't know you were here
I asked if there was anybody there?
someone replied yes, one went

164
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:33,427
if you want to change the route,
all should be aware and
prediscussed

165
00:43:33,427 --> 00:43:41,185
but no one is blaming
simply don't do like that
if we agreed on a route, we go

166
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:51,061
(inaudible)


167
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:45,215
So what? Let's go away?
I would ride one more time
I can not ride this wet snow

168
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:55,459
are you going to ride on
Kuryatnya? yes

169
00:44:55,459 --> 00:45:10,507
on the left, there is a couloir,
we don't go there, on the right
ski lift, in front of the slope

170
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:26,707
straight from the top shelf,
here near the forest,
but not from the peak

171
00:46:49,590 --> 00:47:00,083
I've started recording

172
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:44,878
We are going to ride 
fucking there to that
ski lift

173
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:45,479
Now we are looking at the ski lift

174
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:27,230
I've almost fucked up

175
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:36,139
Mr. Bohdan can't 
catch up with us

176
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:57,411
Great (ride)
